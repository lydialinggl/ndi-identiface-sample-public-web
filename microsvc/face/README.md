# Identiface Backend Service

Please get the **run.sh** and **X.509 Public Certificate** files from our **Welcome Package for Developers**.

**run.sh** contains the necessary API keys to connect to our authorisation APIs using the OAuth2 token flow.

**X.509 Public Certificate** contains our Public Key that will be used to verify the JWS Signature & Payload.

You will need these to launch the backend service.
